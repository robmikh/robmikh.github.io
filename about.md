Hi there, my name is Robert Mikhayelyan. I'm a software developer at Microsoft on the [Windows Composition](https://twitter.com/WindowsUI) team. With that said, while the contents of this blog relate to what we build at Microsoft, this blog is of my own and not affiliated with Microsoft in any way. Now that that's out of the way...

What you'll find here are posts related to development of UWP applications for Windows 10, usually involving the [Composition API](https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsUIDevLabs).

I hope you enjoy your stay!

Feel free to check out my projects on GitHub:
